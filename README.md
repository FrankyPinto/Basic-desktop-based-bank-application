# Basic-desktop-based-bank-application

This was a Second Year college project. It's not a full fledged bank app.
The project just aims to demonstrate the working of Python based tkinter GUI with MySQL as the database.

> # A brief description of the project:

> **There are two types of users: Admin & Customer**

> Main Page:

* Debit: Remove entered amount from your balance
* Update: Has options to update name and / or password
* View Info: View your profile
